        body: 'I had the pleasure of working with Kristian on our Internship group project at Publicis Sapient and it was a great experience. Kristian was incredibly diligent with his work and always made sure that everything was done to a high standard, making sure he kept everyone up to speed along the way. He is a great big-picture thinker and is able to break down complex systems into small, readable and reusable code. This part of his skillset was especially useful when breaking our project down initially as it was the largest project any of our group had undertaken in that time limit. It\'s clear that alongside being technical, Kristian possesses great people skills and I can say with confidence that everyone in our team thoroughly enjoyed working with him. Overall, Kristian was a great colleague to work with and I would definitely recommend him for any future projects.',
